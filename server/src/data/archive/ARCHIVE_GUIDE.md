## CSV Format Requirements

### Period Stats Files

**Filename Pattern**: `period_N.csv` or `Period_N.csv` (where N is the period number 1-7)

**Required Columns**:
```csv
player_name,mlb_id,team_code,is_pitcher,AB,H,R,HR,RBI,SB,AVG,W,SV,K,IP,ER,ERA,WHIP
```

**Column Specifications**:
- `player_name`: Abbreviated player name (e.g., "S. Ohtani", "J. Altuve")
  - ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: No commas in names! Use periods instead
  - ✅ Good: "H. Badeer" 
  - ❌ Bad: "H, Badeer"
- `mlb_id`: MLB Stats API player ID (can be empty if using reference lookup)
- `team_code`: 3-4 letter team code (e.g., "DKD", "SDS", "DD2")
- `is_pitcher`: `true` or `false`
- Stats columns: Numeric values or empty for null

**Optional Columns** (will be populated if reference exists):
- `full_name`: Full player name
- `position`: Player position
- `mlb_team`: MLB team abbreviation

### Draft Files

**Filename Pattern**: `draft_YYYY_auction.csv` (where YYYY is the year)

**Required Columns**:
```csv
player_name,team_code,mlb_team,is_pitcher,position,draft_dollars
```

**Column Specifications**:
- `player_name`: Abbreviated player name (e.g., "S. Ohtani")
- `team_code`: Fantasy team code (e.g., "DKD", "SDS")
- `mlb_team`: MLB team abbreviation (optional)
- `is_pitcher`: `true` or `false`
- `position`: Player position (e.g., "OF", "1B", "SP")
- `draft_dollars`: Dollar amount spent in auction

### Season Standings Files

**Filename**: `season_standings.csv` (optional)

```csv
team_code,team_name,R_score,HR_score,RBI_score,SB_score,AVG_score,W_score,SV_score,K_score,ERA_score,WHIP_score,total_score,final_rank
```

---

## Import Process

### Standard Import (New Data)

**Script**: [`import_historical_archive.ts`](file:///Users/jameschang/Documents/Projects/fbst/server/src/scripts/import_historical_archive.ts)

```bash
cd server
npx tsx src/scripts/import_historical_archive.ts <year>
```

**What it does**:
1. Creates/updates `HistoricalSeason` record for the year
2. Creates `HistoricalPeriod` records for each period CSV found
3. Imports player stats from each CSV file
4. Optionally imports season standings if file exists

**Example**:
```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/import_historical_archive.ts 2024
```

### Import with MLB ID Reference

After importing, if you have MLB ID reference files, propagate them:

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/propagate_mlb_ids.ts
```

This copies MLB IDs across all periods for each player.

---

## MLB ID Reference System

### Purpose

The MLB ID reference system maintains a persistent mapping of player abbreviations to their MLB IDs, full names, and positions. This allows:
- Quick recovery after data loss
- Consistent player identification across years
- Easy population of new imports

### Reference File Location

```
server/src/data/mlb_id_reference/
├── 2023_mlb_ids.json    # JSON format (machine-readable)
├── 2023_mlb_ids.csv     # CSV format (human-readable)
├── 2024_mlb_ids.json
├── 2024_mlb_ids.csv
├── 2025_mlb_ids.json
└── 2025_mlb_ids.csv
```

### Exporting MLB ID Reference

**When to export**: After manually correcting player MLB IDs or completing a new season's data entry.

**Script**: [`export_mlb_id_reference.ts`](file:///Users/jameschang/Documents/Projects/fbst/server/src/scripts/export_mlb_id_reference.ts)

```bash
cd server
npx tsx src/scripts/export_mlb_id_reference.ts
```

**Output**: Creates JSON and CSV files for all years in the database (2023-2025).

### Reference File Format

**JSON**:
```json
{
  "year": 2024,
  "exportDate": "2026-01-17T17:29:12.000Z",
  "totalPlayers": 130,
  "players": [
    {
      "playerName": "S. Ohtani",
      "fullName": "Shohei Ohtani",
      "mlbId": "660271",
      "teamCode": "DKD",
      "position": "DH",
      "isPitcher": false
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**CSV**:
```csv
playerName,fullName,mlbId,teamCode,position,isPitcher
"S. Ohtani","Shohei Ohtani",660271,DKD,"DH",false
```

## Recovery Process

If you accidentally lose MLB ID data (e.g., by importing from CSVs without MLB IDs):

### Step 1: Check Current State

```bash
cd server
npx tsx src/scripts/check_mlb_ids.ts
```

Output shows how many players have MLB IDs in each year.

### Step 2: Propagate Existing MLB IDs

If some MLB IDs survived, propagate them across all periods:

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/propagate_mlb_ids.ts
```

This finds players with MLB IDs in any period and copies them to all their other periods.

### Step 3: Verify Recovery

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/check_mlb_ids.ts
```

Check the final coverage percentage.

### Step 4: Export Reference (For Future Use)

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/export_mlb_id_reference.ts
```

Saves current MLB ID mappings so you don't lose them again.

### Step 5: Manual Completion

For remaining players without MLB IDs:
1. Use the Archive page UI
2. Click "Search Players" feature
3. Look up missing players
4. Update MLB IDs through the interface

OR use the fetch script to search MLB API:

```bash
cd server  
npx tsx src/scripts/fetch_2024_mlb_teams.ts
```

(This searches the MLB Stats API by player name and updates the database)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Import fails with "Invalid number of columns"

**Cause**: Player name contains a comma (e.g., "H, Badeer")

**Solution**: 
1. Find the offending row in the CSV
2. Change comma to period: "H. Badeer"
3. Re-run import

**Prevention**: Always use periods in abbreviated names, never commas.

### Issue: MLB IDs not showing after import

**Cause**: CSV files don't contain MLB IDs

**Solution**: Use the propagation script or reference files (see [Recovery Process](#recovery-process))

### Issue: Duplicate players or missing players

**Cause**: Inconsistent player name abbreviations across periods

**Solution**:
1. Check reference CSV files for canonical player names
2. Update source CSVs to use consistent abbreviations
3. Re-import

### Issue: "No periods found" when importing

**Cause**: CSV filenames don't match expected pattern

**Expected patterns**:
- `period_1.csv`, `period_2.csv`, etc. (lowercase)
- `Period_1.csv`, `Period_2.csv`, etc. (capitalized)

**Solution**: Rename files to match pattern or update import script to recognize your naming convention.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always export MLB ID reference after completing/correcting data**
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/scripts/export_mlb_id_reference.ts
   ```

2. **Use consistent player name abbreviations**
   - First initial + period + space + last name
   - Example: "S. Ohtani", not "Shohei Ohtani" or "S.Ohtani"

3. **Never use commas in player names in CSV files**
   - Use periods for abbreviations instead

4. **Keep a backup of reference files**
   - Commit `server/src/data/mlb_id_reference/` to version control
   - These files are small and invaluable for recovery

5. **Verify imports before deleting source**
   - Check player counts match expectations
   - Spot-check a few players have MLB IDs
   - Review standings calculations

6. **Document any manual corrections**
   - If you manually fix player data, note it
   - Re-export reference files after fixes

## Recovery Example: Real Scenario

**What happened**: Ran `import_historical_archive.ts` which wiped database and re-imported from CSVs. CSV files had empty MLB ID fields, so all MLB IDs were lost.

**Recovery steps**:
1. Ran `check_mlb_ids.ts` → Found 129 MLB IDs survived in 2024, 180 in 2025
2. Ran `propagate_mlb_ids.ts` → Propagated IDs to 681 records (53% coverage) for 2024
3. Ran `export_mlb_id_reference.ts` → Saved mappings for future use
4. Manually corrected remaining ~54 players without IDs using Archive UI
5. Ran `export_mlb_id_reference.ts` again to save complete mappings

**Result**: Full recovery of MLB IDs with persistent backup in reference files.
