          <p>The auction is a <strong>live, real-time event</strong> where all team owners bid on players simultaneously. Each team starts with a budget and fills their roster one player at a time.</p>

            <li>Teams take turns <strong>nominating</strong> a player — then <strong>all teams can bid</strong></li>
            <li>Highest bidder when the timer expires <strong>wins the player</strong></li>

            <Step num={1} title="Wait for Your Turn">
              Teams nominate in rotation. The <strong>Nomination Order</strong> panel shows who's up. When it's your turn, you'll hear a sound alert and see <span className="text-[var(--lg-accent)] font-semibold">"Your turn — select a player"</span>. A countdown timer (default 30s) shows how long before your turn is auto-skipped.
            </Step>
            <Step num={2} title="Find a Player in the Player Pool">
              Switch to the <strong>Player Pool</strong> tab on the right side. Use the filters:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-1 ml-2 space-y-0.5">
                <li><strong>H / P</strong> — switch between hitters and pitchers</li>
                <li><strong>All / Avail / ★</strong> — all players, available only, or your starred watchlist</li>
                <li><strong>NL / AL / All</strong> — filter by MLB league</li>
                <li><strong>Pos / Team</strong> — filter by position or MLB team</li>
                <li><strong>Search</strong> — type a player name</li>
              </ul>
            </Step>
            <Step num={3} title="Click Nom">
              Click the <strong>Nom</strong> button next to any available player. A small <strong>$ input</strong> appears — type your opening bid (default $1) and press <strong>Enter</strong> or click <strong>Go</strong>.
            </Step>
          </div>
          <Tip>Pre-load your <strong>Nomination Queue</strong> — click the expand arrow on any player, then "Add to Queue." When it's your turn, the first available player in your queue auto-nominates after 1.5 seconds.</Tip>

        <Section title="Bidding on a Player" icon={Target} defaultOpen>
          <div className="space-y-3">
            <Step num={1} title="Place a Bid">
              Once a player is nominated, use the <strong>+$1</strong> or <strong>+$5</strong> buttons to bid. Each new bid resets the timer, giving everyone a chance to respond.
            </Step>
            <Step num={2} title="Set a Proxy / Max Bid (Optional)">
              Click <strong>"Set Max Bid (auto-bid)"</strong> to enter your maximum price. The system bids $1 at a time on your behalf — just like eBay. If two proxy bids compete, the higher one wins at the lower's max + $1. <strong>Your max bid is always private.</strong>
            </Step>
            <Step num={3} title="Pass on a Player">
              Don't want to bid? Click <strong>"Pass (sit out this player)"</strong> to hide the bid buttons. You can rejoin at any time by clicking <strong>"Rejoin Bidding."</strong>
            </Step>
            <Step num={4} title="Winning">
              When the timer hits zero, the highest bidder wins. As the timer counts down you'll see:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-1 ml-2">
                <li>At 5 seconds: <span className="text-amber-400 font-bold">"Going once..."</span></li>
                <li>At 3 seconds: <span className="text-red-400 font-bold">"Going twice..."</span></li>
                <li>At 1 second: <span className="text-red-400 font-black">"SOLD!"</span></li>
              </ul>
            </Step>
          </div>
          <Tip>When you're the high bidder, you'll see <strong>"Keeper next year: $price+5"</strong> — helping you plan for next season.</Tip>

          <p><strong>My Val</strong> shows a personalized player value based on YOUR team's specific needs. It adjusts the base projected value using 4 factors:</p>

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-1 mt-3">
            <li><strong>Position Need</strong> — Players at positions you still need are worth more (+30%). Players at positions you've already filled are worth less (-70%).</li>
            <li><strong>Budget Pressure</strong> — If a player costs more than 2x your average remaining $/spot, their value is deflated (-20%). Bargains get a boost (+10%).</li>
            <li><strong>Position Scarcity</strong> — When 3-5+ other teams also need that position, competition drives the value up (+10-20%).</li>
            <li><strong>Market Pressure</strong> — League-wide budget/spots ratio affects all values. When teams are flush, values inflate. When budgets are tight, values deflate.</li>
          </ol>

          <p className="mt-3">Hover over any My Val number to see: <em>"Base: $24 → Your value: $31 (+7 based on roster needs)"</em></p>

          <p className="mt-2">The minimum value is always $1 — no player shows $0 or negative.</p>

          <p className="mt-2">Values update in real-time as you draft players and your roster composition changes.</p>
