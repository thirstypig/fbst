# FBST — Technical Debt & Feature Roadmap

Tracked items from tech debt audits (Sessions 7-26) and 6-agent code review (Session 27).
Items grouped by priority. P1 = fix before live auction (Mar 22), P2 = fix soon, P3 = when convenient.

---

## P1 — Critical (fix before Sunday auction)

### Auction Reliability

- [x] **CR-01**: Await `AuctionLot.update` in `finishCurrentLot` — currently fire-and-forget, lot stays "active" in DB if update fails while roster entry is already created. Data integrity risk for bid-history endpoint.
  - File: `server/src/features/auction/routes.ts:391-394`
  - Fix: `await` the Prisma call or wrap roster+lot in a transaction
  - Effort: Small

- [x] **CR-02**: `AuctionDraftLog` re-fetches bid history on every log event — useEffect depends on `log.length` but only WIN events add new data. Causes 3-5x unnecessary API calls during live auction, multiplied by concurrent viewers.
  - File: `client/src/features/auction/components/AuctionDraftLog.tsx:57`
  - Fix: Derive `winCount` from log, use `[leagueId, winCount]` as dependency
  - Effort: Small

- [x] **CR-03**: `checkPositionLimit` re-queries DB on every bid — data already exists in `state.teams[].pitcherCount/hitterCount` and `state.config.pitcherCount/batterCount`. ~690 unnecessary queries per full auction.
  - File: `server/src/features/auction/routes.ts:259-288`
  - Fix: Use in-memory state instead of Prisma query; also skip redundant `loadLeagueConfig` call
  - Effort: Small

---

## P2 — Important (fix soon)

### Security

- [x] **CR-04**: `player-season-stats` defaults `leagueId: 1` without membership check — any authenticated user can view any league's roster composition and auction prices.
  - File: `server/src/features/players/routes.ts:478`
  - Fix: Require `leagueId` param (400 if missing) and add `requireLeagueMember`, or strip roster fields for non-members
  - Effort: Small

- [x] **CR-05**: `persistState` swallows errors with `.catch(() => {})` — silent auction state loss if DB connection drops. Server restart would lose auction progress with no warning.
  - File: `server/src/features/auction/routes.ts:135`
  - Fix: Change to `.catch((err) => logger.error({ error: String(err), leagueId }, "Failed to persist auction state"))`
  - Effort: Small

### Code Duplication

- [x] **CR-06**: `positionToSlots()` duplicated in `auction/routes.ts` (server) and `PlayerPoolTab.tsx` (client) — identical logic. Should live in `sportConfig.ts` on both sides.
  - Files: `server/src/features/auction/routes.ts:233-244`, `client/src/features/auction/components/PlayerPoolTab.tsx:32-43`
  - Fix: Add to `server/src/lib/sportConfig.ts` and `client/src/lib/sportConfig.ts` (or `baseballUtils.ts`), import from there
  - Effort: Small

- [x] **CR-07**: `NL_TEAMS`/`AL_TEAMS` redefined locally in `PlayerPoolTab.tsx` instead of importing from `sportConfig.ts`. Local version also has extra `"AZ"` alias not in canonical set.
  - File: `client/src/features/auction/components/PlayerPoolTab.tsx:48-49`
  - Fix: Import from `client/src/lib/sportConfig.ts`, add `"AZ"` to canonical set if needed
  - Effort: Small

- [x] **CR-08**: `PITCHER_CODES` vs `PITCHER_POS` naming inconsistency — same set under different names. Canonical `sportConfig.ts` also missing `"TWP"` (two-way player).
  - Files: `PlayerPoolTab.tsx:45` (`PITCHER_POS`), `auction/routes.ts:246` (`PITCHER_CODES`), `sportConfig.ts` (both sides)
  - Fix: Add `"TWP"` to canonical `PITCHER_CODES`, import everywhere, remove local copies
  - Effort: Small

### Type Safety

- [x] **CR-09**: `AuctionLogEvent` redeclared in `AuctionDraftLog.tsx` with `type: string` instead of importing the union type (`'NOMINATION' | 'BID' | 'WIN' | ...`) from `types.ts`.
  - File: `client/src/features/auction/components/AuctionDraftLog.tsx:28-36`
  - Fix: Import from auction types (already available on client side via `useAuctionState.ts`)
  - Effort: Small

- [x] **CR-10**: `@ts-expect-error` for dynamic stat key access in `PlayerPoolTab.tsx` — should use a `StatKey` union type for `sortKey` state.
  - File: `client/src/features/auction/components/PlayerPoolTab.tsx:117-121`
  - Fix: Define `type StatKey = 'name' | 'R' | 'HR' | 'RBI' | 'SB' | 'AVG' | 'W' | 'SV' | 'K' | 'ERA' | 'WHIP'`, type `sortKey` and `getStat` with it
  - Effort: Small

## P3 — Nice-to-Have (when convenient)

### Dead Code & Cleanup

- [x] **CR-11**: Unused imports in `PlayerPoolTab.tsx` — `ThemedTable`, `ThemedThead`, `ThemedTh`, `ThemedTr`, `ThemedTd` (line 3) and `PITCHER_POS` constant (line 45). Remove.
  - Effort: Trivial

- [x] **CR-12**: Double `useLeague()` call in `AuctionDraftLog.tsx` (lines 44 & 59) — merge into single destructure.
  - Effort: Trivial

- [x] **CR-13**: Dead ternary `colCount = viewGroup === 'hitters' ? 9 : 9` — always 9. Inline or simplify.
  - File: `client/src/features/auction/components/PlayerPoolTab.tsx:192`
  - Effort: Trivial

- [x] **CR-14**: Missing `useMemo` on `teamMap` and `completedLots` in `AuctionDraftLog.tsx` — recomputed on every render (tab switch, expand/collapse, WebSocket updates).
  - File: `client/src/features/auction/components/AuctionDraftLog.tsx:61,64`
  - Effort: Small

### Architecture

- [x] **CR-15**: Stats fetching logic (~140 LOC) inline in `players/routes.ts` — violates feature-module pattern. Should extract to `players/services/statsService.ts`.
  - File: `server/src/features/players/routes.ts:25-140`
  - Effort: Medium

- [x] **CR-16**: Raw `<table>` instead of ThemedTable in `AuctionDraftLog.tsx` and `PlayerPoolTab.tsx` — added `compact` variant to ThemedTable via React context, migrated both files.
  - Effort: Medium

### Existing Open Items

- [ ] **TD-Q03**: `auction/routes.ts` (874 LOC) — extraction deferred; real-time stateful system with in-memory state + timers; 72+ tests pass. Revisit after auction season.

- [x] **RD-01**: Lazy-load heavy modules — `xlsx` (2.3MB) and `@google/generative-ai` (1.2MB) loaded eagerly
- [x] **RD-02**: Prisma singleton enforcement — 8 scripts converted to import from `db/prisma.ts`
- [x] **RD-03**: npm audit in CI — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` blocks on critical vulnerabilities
- [x] **RD-04**: Shared component extraction — moved `PlayerDetailModal` and `StatsTables` to `client/src/components/shared/`

## Auction Feature Ideas (backlog)

Future auction enhancements, roughly ordered by impact.

### High Impact
- [ ] **AUC-01**: Nominator sets opening bid — let nominator choose starting bid (not always $1). Backend `startBid` already supported, client hardcodes `1`.
- [ ] **AUC-02**: Watchlist / Favorites — star players in the Player Pool for quick filtering. Different from nomination queue (which auto-nominates).
- [ ] **AUC-03**: Chat / Trash Talk — real-time chat sidebar via existing WebSocket. Social feature for live auctions.
- [ ] **AUC-04**: Bid Notifications / Sound Effects — audio ping on outbid, your turn, critical time. Keeps engagement when in another tab.

### Medium Impact
- [ ] **AUC-05**: Value Over Replacement in Player Pool — show delta between projected value and current bid during live bidding ("Value: $35 | Bid: $22 | Surplus: +$13").
- [ ] **AUC-06**: Spending Pace Tracker — visual per-team budget burn rate ("$180 on 12 players, avg $15, $220 left for 11 spots").
- [ ] **AUC-07**: Position Needs Matrix — grid showing each team's filled/open positions in Team List tab. Reveals who needs the current player.
- [ ] **AUC-08**: Nomination Timer Countdown — visible countdown when it's your turn to nominate (30s default). Auto-skip exists but UX could be clearer.
- [ ] **AUC-09**: "Going Once, Going Twice" Visual — escalating visual flourish at 5s/3s/1s (border pulse, text callout, "SOLD!" animation).

### Nice-to-Have
- [ ] **AUC-10**: Pre-Draft Rankings Import — owners upload personal player rankings (CSV) as a private column in Player Pool.
- [ ] **AUC-11**: Post-Auction Trade Block — immediately after draft, owners flag players they'd trade.
- [ ] **AUC-12**: Keeper Cost Preview — during bidding, show next year's keeper cost ("If you keep next year: $bid + $5").
