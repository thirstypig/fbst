# isPP needless alias in aiAnalysisService

## Problem Statement
`aiAnalysisService.ts` lines 502 and 1052 create `const isPP = isPitcherPos` — a needless alias that reduces clarity. `isPitcherPos` is already imported at the top of the file.

## Proposed Solutions
Replace `isPP` with `isPitcherPos` directly. Remove alias lines.
- **Effort**: Small

## Technical Details
- **Affected files**: `server/src/services/aiAnalysisService.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `isPP` alias removed, `isPitcherPos` used directly
- [ ] Tests pass
